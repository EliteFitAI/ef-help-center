---

### Q: Can anyone see me while I’m working out?

**A:** We don’t have access to your camera, hence there is no way for us to see what you are doing. No one can see you work out, not even EliteFit.AI. We do not record any videos or capture any images.

---

**A:** This happens mainly on slower or older devices. If there are multiple tabs open on the browser, close all except for the workout page and try again.

### Q: How is calorie calculated?

**A:** It’s an estimate based on your weight, workout time, and workout intensity.

---

### Q: How accurate is your accuracy score?

**A:** It is as accurate as a real person viewing and evaluating your accuracy. It depends on your distance from the camera, the lighting in your room, and your clothes.

---

### Q: Why can’t I see my calorie count? My calorie counter shows ‘- -‘

**A:** To see real-time calorie count for your workouts, you will need to update your weight under your profile page. To calculate calories, weight is an integral parameter.

---

### Q: How accurate is your calorie counter? How do you calculate calories?

**A:** Our calorie counter uses MET (Metabolic Equivalent of a Task) values to gauge the intensity of the workout and the weight of the user to calculate calories burnt per minute. MET values are industry-standard and are part of research done at Harvard University.

---

### Q: Why does my accuracy score not increase or decrease after some time or in longer workouts?

**A:** We capture an accuracy score every 3-5 seconds and display the cumulative average of that value as you progress in the workout. As you progress in longer workouts, your average accuracy score has already reached a value, and to change the average accuracy score, you need to either make drastic improvements or degrade the workout you are doing.

---

### Q: What are the messages on the screen that keep popping up while I’m working out?

**A:** The messages are assistive feedback in the form of ‘stickers.’ These stickers provide users with immediate correction messages to rectify their pose, pace, camera angle, etc. In addition, stickers also display an average accuracy score once you hit a high point, e.g., 50% accuracy or 75% accuracy. This score is just an indicative message that you have reached that level of accuracy.

---

### Q: Why do I see the accuracy score ring on the left side and on the right side in the form of the sticker?

**A:** Stickers are a form of assistive feedback to help users with real-time corrections to improve their pose, pace, camera angle, etc. In addition, stickers also display an average accuracy score once you hit a high point, e.g., 50% accuracy or 75% accuracy. This score is just an indicative message that you have reached that level of accuracy.

---

### Q: What is “Effective Workout Minutes”?

**A:** Effective Workout Minutes are derived as “Average Accuracy” multiplied by “Workout minutes,” and can be seen as a proxy for “high-quality” workout minutes.

---

### Q: What is the matrix?

**A:** Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.

---

### Q: Why are push notifications working fine on my Redmi device?  
**Ans:** The smooth functionality on your Redmi device suggests that the core push notification setup is working as expected on this device. However, different devices may have varying configurations that could affect how notifications are displayed. This means the system is functional but may require device-specific adjustments.

---

### Q: How can I ensure push notifications work consistently across all devices?  
**Ans:**  
To ensure consistency across devices, please follow these steps:  
- **Browser Permissions**: Ensure that browser permissions are consistently set across all devices to allow push notifications.  
- **Clear Cache and Cookies**: Clearing the browser cache and cookies might help ensure the latest configurations are applied.  
- **Check Browser and OS Versions**: Verify that all devices are running the latest versions of their browsers and operating systems to prevent compatibility issues.  

---

### Q: Why are push notifications not showing on the home screen of my Samsung device?

### Q: How do I find my **Session ID**?

**Answer:** Your **Session ID** is typically found in the workout URL or through your browser’s developer tools (if exposed). Here’s how you can locate it:

  `https://www.elitefitforyou.com/user/end-workout/v2?sessionId=63ef9b27-5ea2-45ae-8faa-4a5aef66e172&returnToOnCancel=%2Fmanagement%2Fvideo%2Flibrary`  
  In this case, the **Session ID** is: `63ef9b27-5ea2-45ae-8faa-4a5aef66e172`

- **From the Developer's Console during an active workout:**  
  Example:  
  `session id ::: 53ef9b27-5ea2-45af-8faa-4a5aef66e172`  
  Here, the **Session ID** is: `53ef9b27-5ea2-45af-8faa-4a5aef66e172`
