## Neutral Setup

An interactive workout experience, with real-time feedback, workout information, user guidance, and navigation options. Border is grey during intro and outro of the workout and white stick figure will be shown. Score will not be affected during this time and If the workout has an intro, our AI does not track your movement

## Colour Coordination

This workout interface provides real-time feedback and progress tracking.  It features a visual "AVERAGE ACCURACY" system where a stick figure and its surrounding border change color to reflect performance. The interface also displays "APPROX. CALORIES" and a timer showing workout duration. This design allows users to quickly gauge their performance and make adjustments as needed.

If accuracy is poor, the stick figure and border will be red.
