### Q: Why is my accuracy score low?

---

### Q: Can anyone see me while I’m working out?

**A:** We don’t have access to your camera, hence there is no way for us to see what you are doing. No one can see you work out, not even EliteFit.AI. We do not record any videos or capture any images.

---

### Q: Why does my browser show ‘this tab is taking too long to load’?

**A:** This happens mainly on slower or older devices. If there are multiple tabs open on the browser, close all except for the workout page and try again.

---

### Q: Do I need to be logged in to use this site?

**A:** There is no need to log in to use the site, however, to access information like past workout summaries and goals you will need to log in.

---

### Q: Can I get AI feedback for any YouTube videos/content creators I follow?

**A:** No, currently you can only access the content that is available on our site. But if you want some specific content then you can reach out to us and we can try to bring it in.

---

### Q: What should I do if my camera isn’t working?

**A:** Try restarting your browser first. When prompted, make sure to grant permission for camera access by selecting ‘Yes’. If the issue persists after these steps, please reach out to us at support@elitefit.ai for further assistance.

---

### Q: Which browsers are supported for the best experience?

**A:**  We support popular browsers like Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox for the best performance. However, Opera is currently not supported.

---

### Q: How is calorie calculated?

**A:** It’s an estimate based on your weight, workout time, and workout intensity.

---

### Q: How accurate is your accuracy score?

**A:** It’s as accurate as having a real person observe and evaluate your performance. The accuracy may vary based on your distance from the camera, the lighting conditions in your room, and how well you maintain proper workout form and posture throughout your session.

---

### Q: Why can’t I see my calorie count? My calorie counter shows ‘- -‘

**A:** To see real-time calorie count for your workouts, you will need to update your weight under your profile page. To calculate calories, weight is an integral parameter.

---

### Q: How accurate is your calorie counter? How do you calculate calories?

**A:** Our calorie counter uses MET (Metabolic Equivalent of a Task) values to gauge the intensity of the workout and the weight of the user to calculate calories burnt per minute. MET values are industry-standard and are part of research done at Harvard University.

---

### Q: Why does my accuracy score not increase or decrease after some time or in longer workouts?

**A:** We capture an accuracy score every 3-5 seconds and display the cumulative average of that value as you progress in the workout. As you progress in longer workouts, your average accuracy score has already reached a value, and to change the average accuracy score, you need to either make drastic improvements or degrade the workout you are doing.

---

### Q: What are the messages on the screen that keep popping up while I’m working out?

**A:** The messages are assistive feedback in the form of ‘stickers.’ These stickers provide users with immediate correction messages to rectify their pose, pace, camera angle, etc. In addition, stickers also display an average accuracy score once you hit a high point. This score is just an indicative message that you have reached that level of accuracy.

---

### Q: What is “Effective Workout Minutes”?

**A:** Effective Workout Minutes are derived as “Average Accuracy” multiplied by “Workout minutes,” and can be seen as a proxy for “high-quality” workout minutes.

---

### Q: What is the matrix?

**A:** Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.

---

### Q: How to raise a support ticket?  
**Ans:** You can click on your name in the top right corner, open the dropdown menu, and select the **"Support Ticket"** option to reach out for help.

### Q: Why are push notifications not showing on the home screen of my Samsung device?  
**Ans:** The behavior you're experiencing may be due to specific device settings or browser permissions. Samsung devices, like many Android devices, may have manufacturer-specific configurations that impact push notifications. We recommend checking:  
- Whether browser permissions are set to allow notifications on the home screen.  
- If "Do Not Disturb" or other notification-blocking modes are enabled.

### Q: How do I find my **Session ID**?

**Answer:** Your **Session ID** is typically found in the workout URL or through your browser’s developer tools (if exposed). Here’s how you can locate it:

- **From the URL after completing a workout:**  
  Example:  
  `https://www.elitefitforyou.com/user/end-workout/v2?sessionId=63ef9b27-5ea2-45ae-8faa-4a5aef66e172&returnToOnCancel=%2Fmanagement%2Fvideo%2Flibrary`  
  In this case, the **Session ID** is: `63ef9b27-5ea2-45ae-8faa-4a5aef66e172`

- **From the Developer's Console during an active workout:**  
  Example:  
  `session id ::: 53ef9b27-5ea2-45af-8faa-4a5aef66e172`  
  Here, the **Session ID** is: `53ef9b27-5ea2-45af-8faa-4a5aef66e172`

- **By checking the browser’s address bar** on the workout summary or end page.
