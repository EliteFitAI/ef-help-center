# Physiotherapy 

Getting started with your workout is simple. Below are answers to common questions to help you optimize your experience—whether you're here for general fitness, rehabilitation, or guided physiotherapy.

---

### Q: What is the silhouette figure that appears on my screen before the workout starts?
**A:** The silhouette image is designed to help you get into the correct starting position before your workout begins. It ensures you're aligned and ready to perform each movement accurately and safely.

---

### Q: Why am I getting fewer reps counted than I actually do?
**A:** Only the reps which achieve the minimum set threshold for the workout are counted. This encourages users to perform movements properly.

---

### Q: Why does the message “Move further back from your device” appear on my screen?
**A:** This message appears when you're too close to the camera, making it difficult for the system to capture your full body. Stepping back ensures your entire form is visible for accurate tracking.

---

### Q: Why does the stick figure flicker while I'm working out?
**A:** Flickering may be caused by poor camera quality, low lighting, or a cluttered background. Improving these conditions can help stabilize the figure.

---

### Q: The camera dropdown option does not show my external camera as an option.
**A:** Ensure that the external camera is enabled on your device, then select it on the pre-workout page.
