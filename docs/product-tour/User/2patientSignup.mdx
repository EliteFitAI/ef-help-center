## Sign Up page

Once patients click the sign-up link from their email, they will be directed to the EliteFit.AI sign-up page. The following steps outline what to expect and how to complete the registration process.

## Steps:

1. On the hospital’s sign-up page, patients will see the hospital’s logo. If the logo is missing, patients should copy and paste the original URL from the email or contact IT support.
2. Enter the patient's credentials (name, email, and password).
3. Click the **“Sign Up”** button.
4. Alternatively, patients can use the **Google Single Sign-On** function for faster registration.
