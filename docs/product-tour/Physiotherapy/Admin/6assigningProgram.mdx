<Admonition type="tip" title="Treatment Plan Name">
  All admins are advised to include the focused body part in the treatment plan name (e.g., Lower Body Workout, Hip Workout).
  If the plan is based on a schedule, mention that as well (e.g., Weekdays Workout for a 5-day plan).
  This ensures users can quickly recognize the purpose and relevance of each plan.
