## Patient onboarding

The onboarding process outlines the initial interaction between the patient, doctor, and physiotherapist to ensure eligibility and platform setup.

**Steps**

1. The patient visits the doctor for a consult.

2. The doctor will examine the patient and determine whether or not they are fit for online physiotherapy.

3. Once the doctor confirms that the patient is eligible for online physiotherapy and the patient is in agreement, the patient shares their email address with the doctor and is assigned to a physiotherapist.

4. The patient is then added as a user on EliteFit.AI by the physiotherapist using their email.

5. The patient will receive a link on their email with a link to sign-up.
